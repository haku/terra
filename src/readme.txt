However it is recomended that instead you direct people to http://terra.aefaradien.net where they can get the most recent version of terra.


2. Requirements
	-VB6 runtimes.  In XP these seem to be standard, otherwise just run it and see.  If you do need them then just search on google and you should find them in loads of places.
	-SQLite3VB.dll (included).  Many thanks to Todd Tanner for making the c dll VB6 compatible (http://tannertech.net/sqlite3vb/index.htm).


3. Install
This program has no auto installer.  To install manually simply create a folder somewhere and put terra.exe and SQLite3VB.dll it in.  It will then automaticly create the following:
	-terra.ini - a small settings file.
	-mediadb.db3 - the sqlite media database.
	-\playlists\ - a directory that will contain the playlists.


4. Function
This has become too long to include here, please see terra.aefaradien.net for more info.
